# Fixes Applied - Region Requests & Timezone Issues

## ✅ Fix 1: Region Requests Not Appearing

### Issue
Admin/Manager page showed "0 requests" even though database had 4 pending requests.

### Root Causes
1. **Case-sensitive role check** - `req.user.role` vs `'admin'` (fixed earlier)
2. **Column name mismatch** - Code used `created_at` but database column is `requested_at`

### Fixed
`src/controllers/regionRequestController.js:44`
```javascript
// Before (WRONG):
query += ' ORDER BY rr.created_at DESC';

// After (FIXED):
query += ' ORDER BY rr.requested_at DESC';
```

### Test
After restart, Admin should see all 4 pending requests from the database.

## ✅ Fix 2: Temporary Access Timezone Issue

### Issue
- User grants "2 minutes" access
- System shows "7 days 5 hours remaining"
- Dates/times appear wrong

### Root Cause
**Timezone mismatch** between:
- Frontend (sends datetime in local timezone - probably IST UTC+5:30)
- Backend (converts to UTC using `.toISOString()`)
- MySQL (compares with `NOW()` which might use server local time)

### Fixed
Added timezone-aware conversion in `temporaryAccessController.js:194-207`:

```javascript
// Old code (WRONG - forced UTC):
const mysqlDateTime = new Date(expires_at).toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace('T', ' ');

// New code (FIXED - respects local timezone):
const expiresDate = new Date(expires_at);
const mysqlDateTime = new Date(expiresDate.getTime() - (expiresDate.getTimezoneOffset() * 60000))
  .toISOString()
  .slice(0, 19)
  .replace('T', ' ');
```

### Added Debug Logging
When you grant temporary access, backend will now log:
```
🕐 Expires_at received from frontend: 2025-10-12T18:08:00.000Z
🕐 Current server time: 2025-10-12T12:36:00.000Z
🕐 MySQL datetime being stored: 2025-10-12 18:08:00
🕐 Difference from now (minutes): 2
```

---

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Restart Backend
Nodemon should auto-restart. Check logs for any errors.

### 2. Test Region Requests
1. Login as Admin
2. Navigate to **Admin → Region Requests**
3. ✅ You should now see all 4 pending requests:
   - HIMILCHAUHAN - West Bengal
   - Ved Chauhan - Goa
   - Ved Chauhan - Maharashtra
   - HIMILCHAUHAN - Karnataka

### 3. Test Temporary Access Duration

**Important: Try granting 2 minutes access again**

1. Go to Temporary Access page
2. Grant a user access for **2 minutes**
3. Check backend logs - you should see:
   ```
   🕐 Difference from now (minutes): 2
   ```
4. The grant should show "2m remaining" not "7d"

### 4. Check Backend Logs

Look for these debug lines when granting access:
```
🕐 Expires_at received from frontend: [timestamp]
🕐 Current server time: [timestamp]
🕐 MySQL datetime being stored: [timestamp]
🕐 Difference from now (minutes): [should be 2]
```

**If the difference shows something like 420 minutes (7 hours) instead of 2:**
- The problem is in the **FRONTEND**
- The frontend is calculating the expiration time incorrectly
- Share the frontend code that calculates `expires_at`

---

## If Issues Persist

### Region Requests Still Showing 0
Run this SQL query to check database:
```sql
SELECT * FROM region_requests WHERE status = 'pending' ORDER BY requested_at DESC;
```

If you see rows, then check backend logs for errors when loading the page.

### Temporary Access Still Wrong Duration

**Check Backend Logs** - Look for the 🕐 emoji lines:

**Scenario A: Frontend sends wrong duration**
```
🕐 Difference from now (minutes): 420  ← This is 7 hours!
```
→ **Frontend bug** - It's calculating the wrong expiration time

**Scenario B: Duration is correct but display is wrong**
```
🕐 Difference from now (minutes): 2  ← Correct!
```
→ **Frontend display bug** - Backend is correct, frontend UI shows wrong time

---

## Summary

✅ Fixed region requests column name (`created_at` → `requested_at`)
✅ Fixed case-sensitive role check (all 3 functions)
✅ Fixed timezone conversion for temporary access
✅ Added debug logging for troubleshooting

**Next Steps:**
1. Test region requests (should show 4 pending)
2. Test granting 2 minutes access
3. Share backend logs (the 🕐 lines) if duration is still wrong
4. If backend shows correct duration but UI doesn't, share frontend code
