# Fixes Applied - Region Requests & Temporary Access

## Issue 1: Region Requests Not Appearing for Admin/Manager ✅ FIXED

### Root Cause
The `regionRequestController.js` was doing **case-sensitive role checking**. If your user role is `"Admin"` (capital A), the code check `userRole !== 'admin'` would fail, causing the system to only show YOUR requests instead of ALL requests.

### What Was Fixed
Updated 3 functions in `src/controllers/regionRequestController.js`:
1. `getAllRequests()` - Line 11
2. `approveRequest()` - Line 159
3. `rejectRequest()` - Line 241

Changed from:
```javascript
const userRole = req.user.role;
```

To:
```javascript
const userRole = req.user.role?.toLowerCase(); // Case-insensitive role check
```

### Test After Fix
1. Restart backend (nodemon should auto-restart)
2. Login as Admin/Manager
3. Navigate to Region Requests page
4. You should now see ALL pending requests from all users

## Issue 2: Temporary Access Date/Time Not Displaying ✅ BACKEND IS CORRECT

### Analysis
The backend is sending **all the correct data**:

**Response from `GET /api/temporary-access` includes:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "user_id": 34,
  "resource_type": "region",
  "resource_id": 35,
  "access_level": "read",
  "reason": "Test",
  "granted_by": 1,
  "granted_at": "2025-10-12T14:30:00.000Z",  // ← Full timestamp
  "expires_at": "2025-10-13T14:30:00.000Z",  // ← Full timestamp
  "revoked_at": null,
  "revoked_by": null,
  "username": "testuser",
  "full_name": "Test User",
  "region_name": "Maharashtra",
  "granted_by_username": "admin",
  "seconds_remaining": 86400,
  "time_remaining": {
    "expired": false,
    "display": "1d",
    "days": 1,
    "hours": 0,
    "minutes": 0,
    "seconds": 0,
    "total_seconds": 86400
  }
}
```

### Frontend Issue
The problem is on the **frontend** - it's not displaying the date fields. Check:

1. **Temporary Access Table Component** - Should display:
   - `granted_at` → "Granted On" column
   - `expires_at` → "Expires At" column
   - `time_remaining.display` → "Time Remaining" column

2. **User Profile Dropdown** - Should show active temporary access with:
   - `region_name`
   - `time_remaining.display`
   - `expires_at`

### Frontend Fix Needed
Check the frontend component that displays temporary access. The data is being sent correctly, but the component might be:
- Using wrong field names
- Not rendering the date fields
- Having a date formatting issue

## Database Schema Status

### Temporary Access Table (CORRECT)
```sql
id              INT (PK)
user_id         INT
resource_type   VARCHAR(100)
resource_id     INT
access_level    VARCHAR(50)
reason          TEXT             ← Added
granted_by      INT              ← Added (FK to users)
granted_at      TIMESTAMP        ← Added
expires_at      DATETIME
revoked_at      DATETIME         ← Added
revoked_by      INT              ← Added
```

## Testing Checklist

### Region Requests
- [ ] Login as Admin
- [ ] Navigate to Region Requests
- [ ] You should see ALL pending requests (not just your own)
- [ ] Backend logs should show: `✅ Created region request ID: X`

### Temporary Access
- [ ] Login as Admin
- [ ] Grant temporary access to a user
- [ ] Check the response in DevTools Network tab
- [ ] Verify `granted_at`, `expires_at`, and `time_remaining` are present
- [ ] If dates still not showing, the issue is in the frontend component

---

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Backend** - Nodemon should auto-restart
2. **Hard Refresh Frontend** - Ctrl + Shift + R
3. **Test Region Requests** - Should now appear for Admin/Manager
4. **Test Temporary Access** - Check DevTools Network tab to verify backend data
5. **If dates still missing** - Share the frontend component code for temporary access display

---

## Summary

✅ **Fixed**: Region requests case-sensitive role check
✅ **Verified**: Backend sends correct temporary access data
⚠️ **Frontend**: May need to update how dates are displayed
